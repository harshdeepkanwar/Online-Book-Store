                            Samiah Brooks never thought she would be "that" girl. But a live tweet of a horrific date just revealed the painful truth: she's been catfished by a three-timing jerk of a boyfriend. Suddenly Samiah -- along with his two other "girlfriends," London and Taylor -- have gone viral online. Now the three new besties are making a pact to spend the next six months investing in themselves. No men and no dating.
                            <br>
                            For once Samiah is putting herself first, and that includes finally developing the app she's always dreamed of creating. Which is the exact moment she meets the deliciously sexy Daniel Collins at work. What are the chances? But is Daniel really boyfriend material or is he maybe just a little too good to be true?<br>

Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most. Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. Combining a captivating romance with a cast of all-too-human characters, it ends with us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.

                            In today's generation, love and relationships have lost the profound effect that they used to have. In a generation where people want to experience non-committal relationships; where love has been reduced to physical intimacy and larger-than-life displays of feelings, Ravinder Singh pens down his story where he portrays the long lost charm and magic of commitment and love. But, after having experienced the terrible loss of a loved one, is it possible to love someone that deeply and immensely again? Can you bare your soul and let yourself vulnerable in front of someone again, knowing that you are risking yet another terrible heartbreak?<br>
                            <b>Fiction interweaved with non-fiction
                            </b><br>
                            Consistent readers of Ravinder Singh's novels have attested that 'Can Love Happen Twice?' can be treated as a sequel to Singh's bestselling 'I Too Had A Love Story'. While the readers came across the passionate and realistic love that Rabin felt for Khushi in 'I Too Had A Love Story' and eventually dealt with the tragedy of her death, 'Can Love Happen Twice?' portrays how even true love can happen more than once. As Ravin meets Simar, he finds the pain in his heart decrease and develops a liking for her; although Simar is no replacement for Khushi. That's how complicated and grey-shaded the area of love is. What's devastating is that he suffers the loss of love yet again, as things don't work out with Simar. Simar leaves him on the same day that he lost Khushi. A book that explores pain and misery and worldly emotions so intensely, is a must have for all book-lovers out there.
