                            <p><span class="description-word" style="font-size: small;">Description : </span>The Universe In A Nutshell is a theoretical physics book written by Stephen Hawking.<br>
                            The Universe In A Nutshell describes to a general audience the various themes relating to the Lucasian professor's work, like Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes, which is part of the superstring theory in quantum mechanics. The book tells readers about the history and philosophies of modern physics.<br>
                            The author's intentions are to merge Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories together into one absolute integrated theory that will describe everything that will happen in the universe.<br>
                            Professor Hawking seeks to reveal science's holy grail, which is the indefinable Theory of Everything that is the crux of the cosmos. In his casual and lucid style, he guides the readers through his quest to find and disclose the facts of the universe, from holography to duality, from quantum theory to M-theory, from supersymmetry to supergravity.<br>
                            Enthusiastically, Professor Hawking asks his readers to be his companion travelers on this astonishing voyage all the way through time and space. This book includes abundance of illustrations that have been printed in four-color, that will help clarify this expedition into an unreal wonderland where strings, sheets and particles move in eleven different dimensions.<br>
                            The Universe In A Nutshell was published by RHUK in 2001. It is available in hardcover.<br>

The facts and theories mentioned in the book are in line with the present knowledge and the scientific methods behind their historical roots. Cosmos was a blockbuster on science TV and Carl Sagan was its presenter. The Series was viewed by half a billion people by the time of Sagan's death in 1996. <br>
                            He was perhaps the best known scientist on the planet. While explaining the origin of this series, Sagan recalled that he was quite positive from his experiences that an immense level of global interest continues in the investigation of planets and in several related scientific topics - the Earth, the origin of life, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, our links with the universe and the Cosmos. He was definite that this concern could be energized through the means of communication media like books and television.<br>
                            The book is available in mass market paperback binding.<br>

                            <p><span class="description-word" style="font-size: small;">Description : </span>Without calculus, we wouldn’t have cell phones, TV, GPS, or ultrasound. We wouldn’t have unraveled DNA or discovered Neptune or figured out how to put 5,000 songs in your pocket.<br>
                            Though many of us were scared away from this essential, engrossing subject in high school and college, Steven Strogatz’s brilliantly creative, down‑to‑earth history shows that calculus is not about complexity; it’s about simplicity. It harnesses an unreal number—infinity—to tackle real‑world problems, breaking them down into easier ones and then reassembling the answers into solutions that feel miraculous.<br>
                            Infinite Powers recounts how calculus tantalized and thrilled its inventors, starting with its first glimmers in ancient Greece and bringing us right up to the discovery of gravitational waves (a phenomenon predicted by calculus). Strogatz reveals how this form of math rose to the challenges of each age: how to determine the area of a circle with only sand and a stick; how to explain why Mars goes “backwards” sometimes; how to make electricity with magnets; how to ensure your rocket doesn’t miss the moon; how to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS.<br>
                            As Strogatz proves, calculus is truly the language of the universe. By unveiling the principles of that language, Infinite Powers makes us marvel at the world anew.
